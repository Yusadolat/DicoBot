The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to this project, which is maintained on GitHub. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.


## We Develop with Github
=======
## ❤️ Ways to Contribute

* Blog or tweet about the project

* Implement a new feature
* Discuss potential ways to improve project
* Improve existing implementation, performance, etc.

## We Use Github Flow, So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

## 🛎 Questions

Please put some effort in requesting a new feature. If someone else is going to implement something, the least you can do is describe the feature in detail, and why it would be useful to others as well.

## 🐛 File a Bug

* You have acknowledged from `--verbose` and `--debug` the errors are likely a bug in this project (and not coming from your environment or a dependency of this project).
* In your issue description, please include:
	* What you expected to see, and what happened instead.
	* Your operating system and other environment information.
	* As much information as possible, such as the command and configuration used.

	* All steps to reproduce the issue.

* See below for instructions on how to set up the project on your machine.
